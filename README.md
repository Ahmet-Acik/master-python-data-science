├── app.py                  # Streamlit main app
├── requirements.txt        # List of dependencies
├── README.md               # Project overview and instructions
│
├── basics/                 # Python basics modules (auto-discovered)
├── core_python/            # Python fundamentals (OOP, exercises)

##  Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmet-Acik/master-python-data-science.git
   cd master-python-data-science
   ```
2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install requirements:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

##  How to Use
- Use the sidebar to switch between "Python Basics" and "Data Science".
- Select a topic to view, edit, and run code interactively.
- Expand the code section to see the full source for each module.
- Practice by editing code and running it directly in the browser.

##  Best Practices
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep Python basics and data science content in separate folders.
- **Reusability:** Use utility modules for shared logic (e.g., code execution, data loading).
- **Extensibility:** Add new modules for advanced topics or new exercises without changing the main app.
- **Documentation:** Use `README.md` and docstrings in your modules.
- **Testing:** (Optional) Add a `tests/` folder for unit tests as your project grows.
