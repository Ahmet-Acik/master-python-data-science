# Master Python for Data Science

A modular, interactive learning platform to master Python fundamentals and data science skills using Streamlit.

## Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit app
- `core_python/`: Python basics, OOP, and exercises
- `data_science/`: Data science modules (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn)
- `quizzes/`: Interactive quizzes
- `utils/`: Utility functions

## Getting Started

1. Install requirements:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Best Practices
- Keep Python basics and data science content in separate folders.
- Use utility modules for shared logic.
- Add new modules for advanced topics or exercises without changing the main app.
- Use docstrings and keep code well-documented.

Happy learning!
